Project 1 for Human Computer Interaction

Negatives of current design:
- Not a symmetrical or pleasing design
- Ground floor instead of 1st floor causes unnecessary extra time to process the difference in the buttons, rather than focusing on the actual floor that is desired.
- Alarm button could easily be clicked by accident
- The important text and buttons are smaller and at the bottom, in case of a real emergency this is not ideal.

Common uses for elevators
- Method of transportation that is an alternate to taking the stairs
- Also useful for carrying heavier items up to higher floors

Common Sequences
- open/close door
- select floor
- emergency/help
