# Hailley's Elevator User Interface
Project 1 for Human Computer Interaction

Negatives of current design:
- Extra circle at the top.
- The entrance for The Roof is on the 10th floor not the top, and there is no indicator of this until exiting the elevator.
- Ground floor instead of 1st floor causes unnecessary extra time to process the difference in the buttons, rather than focusing on the actual floor that is desired.
- Alarm button could easily be clicked by accident
- The important text and buttons are smaller and at the bottom, in case of a real emergency this is not ideal.

Common uses for elevators
- Method of transportation that is an alternate to taking the stairs
- Also useful for carrying heavier items up to higher floors

Common Sequences
- open/close door
- select floor

Rare Sequences
- emergency
- call
